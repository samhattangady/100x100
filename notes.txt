# Creating a text dissolve effect
We want to create a convincing text dissolve effect, where it feels like every
pixel dissolves convincingly. To do this in a forward direction is fairly
straightforward. Just a matter of applying noise to every pixel relative to its
position, and thats it. The harder problem that we are trying to solve is to do
this in reverse. Where we want to reverse the effects of that same dissolve,
such that the text can un-dissolve into a different text. That's what is
exciting as a prospect. So lets try it out and see what we can accomplish...

Note: We want this to happen in web.

So we would have to generate the textures on the fly. Which seems okay in
general I guess. The issue is that saving it might be a bit of a bitch. Though I
think that would just be from a code perspective. I think running it shouldn't
be too hard really.

Okay what are the things required to store in the font atlas information? That's
what we have to figure out. For each letter, we should ideally just need the 4
texcoords. That should be it.
